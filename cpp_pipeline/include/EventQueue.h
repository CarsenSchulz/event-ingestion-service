/*
 * EventQueue
 * ------------
 * A non-blocking, single-consumer FIFO queue for Event objects.
 * Guarantees:
 * - FIFO ordering: oldest events are dequeued first
 * - Drop-on-full: enqueue returns false if capacity is reached
 * - Single consumer: only one thread should dequeue events
 * - Ownership: enqueued Event objects are moved into the queue
 * - Non-blocking: enqueue never waits, always returns immediately
 */
