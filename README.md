# Backend & Systems Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains two projects focused on backend and systems-oriented software engineering.
Together, they demonstrate how software can be designed to solve complex problems with an emphasis
on performance, correctness, and maintainability.

The projects intentionally explore different layers of backend development:
- Low-level, performance-sensitive systems written in C++
- High-level backend service design using Python

Rather than being feature-complete applications, these projects are designed to highlight
engineering fundamentals, architectural decision-making, and clear paths for future optimization.

## Projects

### C++ Low-Latency Market Data Pipeline
A performance-focused event processing pipeline implemented in C++, exploring low-latency design,
measurement, and optimization strategies.

### Python API Backend
A RESTful backend service built with FastAPI, emphasizing clean API design, validation, and
extensible architecture suitable for production systems.

Each project includes its own README with detailed design decisions, implementation notes,
and planned improvements.
